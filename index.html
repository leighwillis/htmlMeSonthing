    <h2>Our Interspecies Home <3  </h2>
    <p> The Jeffrey family is an interspecies household with humans and dogs sharing everything that
        respectable familes share. The two of us who are of the four-legged variety have access to almost everything that the two-legged 
        animals do. We stay inside the house most of the time using the furniture, rugs, and food sources. We stay dry under the roof when it is raining
        and we stay warm when it is cold. During the summer months, when it is hot as hades in Memphis, we stay cool inside, lounging on the 
        linoleum and hardwood floors under the AC. We have a large fenced-in yard that we run around in and hunt squirrels. Moka also hunts birds and cats. 
        Although one day, a neighbor's chicken came into the yard and Eudora shook it to death. We have decided that was the right thing to do. Our yard is not
        a chicken coop.

    <h2>Eudora's Brief Autobiography</h2>
    <p> My name is Eudora; I was named after the famous southern writer, Eudora Welty.
         I don't like to write much but I am into interior design. I rearrange pillows, blankets and throw rugs
         on a daily basis.  As you can see from my main picture, I am extremely beautiful. Both of my eyes
         as well as both of my ears, go in opposite directions. 
         No-one in the world looks just like me! My favorite game is to play catch with one of my humans inside the house. It's really fun 
         to watch my human, we call "Mom", trying to avoid breaking any glass items with the ball.
         <br>
         I must tell you, though, that even though I love my home, there are major terrorist activites that go on during the January and July 
         months (and sometimes when it rains).  I cannot stand the horrific noises that make me want to crawl out of my skin
         and sit on my Mom's lap (please note the picture below with me demonstrating some hearing protection headphones.) When these noises start 
         and I jump
         onto my Mom's lap she tells me that 75 lbs is too big to be a lap dog. Usually, however, she is quite forgiving. 
         I really wish they would stop doing these 
         horrific noise attacks.
         
        <br><br>
        I would like to add that Moka, my friend and roommate, is also my daughter. She was the smallest of all of my children
        and my humans decided to keep her and give away the rest of my children. That was OK, because as it turns out, she has turned out to be quite a 
        handful to raise. I doubt it would have worked out well if her brothers and sister had stayed with us.

    <h2>Moka's Brief Autobiography</h2>
    <p>My name is Moka. Just like my mother, Eudora, I am extremely beautiful. I have the head of a pitbull and the body of a boxer 
        which allows me to be able to defy the laws of gravity; particularly when it comes to fences and human beds. I have somehow aquired a few nicknames
        which include but are not limited to: chino, sweet potato, al pacino, pretty pitty, and big girl. I don't have any favorite "games"
        so-to-speak, other than wrestling with my mother and running around in circles like a maniac in the yard.
        <br>
        I am admittedly a bit of a "foodie" and have enjoyed sampling some of the best shoe leather, shoe vinyl, belt leather, ball caps, dirty socks,
        sunglasses, ink pens, and unsavory yard items the home has to offer. Fortunately, my cast-iron stomach has survived these binges 
        so far...
